I'm not sure what Anon had in mind, but what annoys me personally is that Discord channels are not publicly indexable, even when the "servers" are joinable via public link. This is especially annoying when some e.g. software project treats their Discord chats as source of related knowledge, and doesn't want to run an actual forum instead. So when you want to find a solution to some problem with such project, you have to join their Discord "server" and only then you'll be able to search and maybe find something. You're required to create an account (or just a pseudonym, depends on admins iirc), agree to Discord Terms of Service, possibly go through phone number verification if Discord (the platform) thinks you're sus, then possibly go through some other "server"-specific verification process (since it's public and otherwise people would join and spam with bots). That's just annoying experience, and a while ago Discord implemented the feature of actual forum-like threads. So it's obvious what they're after – stealing the thunder of open, easily searchable via Google/whatever forums, and making it a closed platform.

I won't deny that the quality of service, especially VoIP is pretty high, but I feel disappointed with this closing down of internet places that Discord (and Facebook, and Telegram sorta, and others...) encourage.

While IRC and Matrix are (at least currently) providing experience some could call "degraded" in comparison to Discord, at the very least these protocols are meant to be open. IRC has had public log services for a long time, Matrix has https://archive.matrix.org that you can use to view any public room. And as such, search engine bots are allowed to go there and let you find knowledge that people posted around those platforms. All without any account bullshit.

Myself I haven't really participated in public Discord "servers" except for a quick question occasionally (since it's the only support channel sometimes...) so I haven't met much circlejerking that apparently could be popular there. That's something people don't like as well.

in case you're wondering why I put Discord "servers" in quotes – they're not actual servers, they're groups of rooms. It makes people very confused when they come to Matrix and hear about servers being actual computers that run Matrix software like Synapse. Equivalent of Discord "servers" on Matrix would be Spaces or communities, depending on the client you prefer to use.
