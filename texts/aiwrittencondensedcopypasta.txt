"Just join our Discord for help!" NO. I am TIRED of this nonsense.

Discord was made for GAMERS, not as your PRIMARY documentation hub!

Why this is TERRIBLE:

1) NOT public! Messages vanish into the void. Search function is *abysmal*. Important info buried under emoji spam WITHIN HOURS.

2) Another account? Another platform? Just to download ONE file? Google can't index it. Can't link to answers without forcing logins!

3) Blocked in workplaces, schools, and countries. Congratulations on your INACCESSIBLE "community"!

4) Security NIGHTMARE! Breaches, vulnerabilities, and help channels CRAWLING with malware. Newbies just clicks away from ransomware.

5) Corporate rot ALREADY HERE! April 2025: Discord replaced founder with Humam Sakhnini (ex-King/Candy Crush president). They're rushing to go public. Voice throttles without verification. Soon: Nitro to copy-paste!

6) One trigger-happy admin finishes their fifth Cheeto bag and decides your server violates policy? POOF! *Everything gone!* One false report = banned across ALL servers. No appeal.

7) IT BREAKS CONSTANTLY! Feb 2025: major outage. Apr 2025: bot API meltdown. Discord hiccups, your entire help system VANISHES.

8) LEGAL DANGERS! Nintendo subpoenaed Discord and they COMPLIED IMMEDIATELY. One takedown and it's ALL GONE.

Use ANYTHING ELSE: Matrix, IRC, Telegram, any cloud storage - Mega, Drive, Dropbox - ANYTHING!

Put documentation on a REAL website. Host files where they're ACCESSIBLE. Create a SEARCHABLE knowledge base.

This isn't just annoying - it's lazy, exclusionary, and making the internet WORSE.

Next time: "No. Put your files on the internet like a normal human being."
